# Hello-World
The first repository created during the tutorial
And this is the first branch also created during the tutorial. What I intend to do is learn how to program using Python. Since my children are doing this in high-school and I've never used it. Most of my coding is in VB and other scripting languages and compiled languages that most people don't know much about.
